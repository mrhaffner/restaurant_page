This is for the Restaurant Page assignment from the Odin Project.  

The purpose of this assignment is to gain proficiency with Webpack, ES6 modules, and npm.

The inspiration for this page comes from Matt's Bar and Grill in Minneapolis - the creator of the Jucy Lucy burger. I took two burger images from their website and edited them together and used their phrase: "Fear the Cheese".  

I would have been completely unaware of Matt's Bar had I not seen someone's bumper sticker inbetween working on this project.  That definitely helped for the final pieces of inspiration and to learn what restaurant actually created the Jucy Lucy (I knew it was somewhere in the Twin Cities!).  Before that bumper sticker, this page spelled "Jucy" correctly, what a mistake!
